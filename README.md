**One EEG Motor Imagery (MI) benchmark** is currently supported. Other benchmarks in the field of EEG or BCI can be found [here](https://github.com/meagmohit/EEG-Datasets).

**The evaluation criteria** consists of

| Evaluation Metrics 					                                       |
| :----:                                                                    |

| Accuracy / Precision / Recall / F1 Score / Kappa Coefficient [[Tutorial]](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-confusion-matrix-a9ad42dcfd62) |
| Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve / Area under the Curve (AUC)|
| Paired-wise t-test (via R language [[Tutorial]](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/05/statistics-t-test-introduction-r-implementation/)) |

*The evaluation metrics are mainly supported for **four-class classification**. If you wish to switch to two-class or three-class classification, please modify [this file](https://github.com/SuperBruceJia/EEG-DL/blob/master/DL_Models/Evaluation_Metrics/Metrics.py) to adapt to your personal Dataset classes. Meanwhile, the details about the evaluation metrics can be found in [this paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/ab4af6/meta).*

## Usage Demo: EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset

1. Download the [EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset](https://archive.physionet.org/pn4/eegmmidb/) via [this script](https://github.com/SuperBruceJia/EEG-DL/blob/master/Download_Raw_EEG_Data/EEG_Motor_Movement_Imagery_Dataset/MIND_Get_EDF.py).

    ```
    (Under Any Python Environment)$ python MIND_Get_EDF.py
    ```

2. Read the .edf files (One of the raw EEG signals formats) and save them into Matlab .m files via [this script](https://github.com/SuperBruceJia/EEG-DL/blob/master/Download_Raw_EEG_Data/EEG_Motor_Movement_Imagery_Dataset/Extract-Raw-Data-Into-Matlab-Files.py). FYI, this script must be executed under the **Python 2 environment (Python 2.7 is recommended)** due to some Python 2 syntax. If using Python 3 environment to run the file, there might be no error, but the labels of EEG tasks would be totally messed up.

    ```
    (Under Python 2.7 Environment)$ python Extract-Raw-Data-Into-Matlab-Files.py
    ```

3. Preprocessed the Dataset via the Matlab and save the data into the Excel files (training_set, training_label, test_set, and test_label) via [these scripts](https://github.com/SuperBruceJia/EEG-DL/tree/master/Preprocess_EEG_Data) with regards to different models. FYI, every lines of the Excel file is a sample, and the columns can be regarded as features, e.g., 4096 columns mean 64 channels X 64 time points. Later, the models will reshape 4096 columns into a Matrix with the shape 64 channels X 64 time points. You should can change the number of columns to fit your own needs, e.g., the real dimension of your own Dataset.

4. Train and test deep learning models **under the Python 3.6 Environment (Highly Recommended)** for EEG signals / tasks classification via [the EEG-DL library](https://github.com/SuperBruceJia/EEG-DL/tree/master/DL_Models), which provides multiple SOTA DL models.

    ```
    Python Version: Python 3.6 (Recommended)
    TensorFlow Version: TensorFlow 1.13.1
    ```

    Use the below command to install TensorFlow GPU Version 1.13.1:

    ```
    pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall tensorflow-gpu==1.13.1 --user
    ```

5. Read evaluation criterias (through iterations) via the [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard). You can follow [this tutorial](https://www.guru99.com/tensorboard-tutorial.html). When you finished training the model, you will find the "events.out.tfevents.***" in the folder, e.g., "/Users/shuyuej/Desktop/trained_model/". You can use the following command in your terminal:

    ```
    tensorboard --logdir="/Users/shuyuej/Desktop/trained_model/" --host=127.0.0.1
    ```

    You can open the website in the [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) (Highly Recommended). 
    
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:6006/
    ```

    Then you can read and save the criterias into Excel .csv files.

6. Finally, draw beautiful paper photograph using Matlab or Python. Please follow [these scripts](https://github.com/SuperBruceJia/EEG-DL/tree/master/Draw_Photos).

## Notice
1. I have tested all the files (Python and Matlab) under the macOS. Be advised that for some Matlab files, several Matlab functions are different between Windows Operating System (OS) and macOS. For example, I used "readmatrix" function to read CSV files in the MacOS. However, I have to use “csvread” function in the Windows because there was no such "readmatrix" Matlab function in the Windows. If you have met similar problems, I recommend you to Google or Baidu them. You can definitely work them out.

2. The **Loss Function** can be changed or modified from [this file](https://github.com/SuperBruceJia/EEG-DL/blob/master/DL_Models/Loss_Function/Loss.py).

3. The **Dataset Loader** can be changed or modified from [this file](https://github.com/SuperBruceJia/EEG-DL/blob/master/DL_Models/DatasetAPI/DataLoader.py).
